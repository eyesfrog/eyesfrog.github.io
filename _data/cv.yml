    - title: Research & Development Intern
      institution: Institute for Quantum Computing, Baidu Research, Beijing
      year: 2021/11 - 2023/05
      description:
        - "Mentor: Dr. Xin Wang"
        - Conducted various research projects in quantum algorithms, quantum information, and quantum machine learning, which lead to top-tier publications and over 20 patents. Discovered the expressivity of quantum neural networks and further extended the model to the multi-qubit quantum phase processing framework, which leads to intuitive and efficient quantum algorithms for solving problems that are particularly phase-related.
        - Involved in developing the Paddle Quantum and Quantum Leaf platform, which allow users to design, test, and deploy quantum programs on quantum simulators and real quantum computers through cloud services. Developed the variable ansatz module, quantum singular value transformation module, quantum phase processing module and the corresponding tutorials.
